# Technical Assessment for Forward-Deployed Engineer

## Overview
In this exercise, you'll work with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), a test automation framework, to add four automated tests for a todo application. You'll be improving tests that were code-generated by Ranger's system for [TodoMVC](https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/#/), a standard todo application implementation widely used for testing and demonstration.

## Your Task
You have 60 minutes to fix, finish, and validate four test scenarios that verify core TodoMVC functionality:

- `addTodos.ts`: Create and verify 4 new todo items
- `editTodo.ts`: Update the text of an existing todo
- `removeTodo.ts`: Delete a todo using the remove button
- `clearAllTodos.ts`: Test the "Clear completed" functionality with completed todos

Your objectives are to:

1. Complete any unfinished test implementations and
2. Replace unreliable element locators with stable ones
3. Streamline test steps by removing redundant actions
4. Implement robust assertions using [Playwright's expect library](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions)
5. Ensure tests run consistently and reliably

Following your independent work, we'll have a brief code review discussion where you'll walk through your implementation and any challenges you encountered. Feel free to use online resources during the assessment.
